# Covid-Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing data related to the COVID-19 pandemic using SQL queries. We work with a database that provides information on Covid-19 cases, infections, population and vaccinations in different areas and countries. The main goal is to gain more knowledge and answer important questions about epidemiology.

We use SQL queries to edit various parts of the COVID-19 data. Here is a summary of the questions and the insights they provide:

1.Death Rate: This question calculates the percentage of deaths relative to the total number of cases. 
This will help us understand how bad the virus is in different places and countries.

2.Percentage of population infected: This question determines the percentage of the population infected by Covid-19.
By comparing the number of cases and the size of the population, it is possible to assess the spread of the disease in different regions.

3.Highest Pollution Rate: This search identifies the country with the highest pollution rate relative to its population. 
It calculates the percentage of the population infected and shows the area with the highest value.

4.Highest Death Rate: This question indicates which country has the highest death rate per population. I
t calculates the percentage of the population that has died due to covid-19 and shows where it is most affected.

5.Country with the highest number of deaths: This question indicates the country with the highest number of deaths. 
This information shows the countries most affected by the virus.

6.Country with the highest number of deaths: This question indicates the country with the highest number of deaths. This helps us understand the impact of the epidemic on a larger scale.

7.Global Cases of the Day: This search provides daily cases of COVID-19,
including the total number of new cases and new infections. 
The death rate is also calculated as a percentage of new cases, which shows the severity of the disease over time.

8.Number of people vaccinated: This query counts the number of people vaccinated per day. 
It follows the total number of people who have been vaccinated, which is displayed along with the size of the population.
In addition, it shows the percentage of the population that has received the vaccine.

By using SQL to analyze COVID-19 data, our project aims to provide meaningful insights into the impact of the virus on different regions,
evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination efforts, and understand the severity of the pandemic over time.
The results of this project can contribute to informed decision-making, resource allocation, and the development of effective public health strategies.
